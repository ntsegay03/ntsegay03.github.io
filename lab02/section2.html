                <p>LAfter moving from the American Football Conference (AFC) to the National Football Conference (NFC) in 2002, the team had much better success. 
                    With players like Matt Hasslbeck, Sean Alexander, and Walter Jones, the Seahawks made their first Super Bowl in 2005, for Super Bowl XL (40). 
                    Unfortunately, with some controversial officiating, they came short of victory and lost.
