The Seattle Seahawks are an American Football Team in the **National Football League**, based in Seattle, Washington. 


## Early History (1970s-90s)
Established in 1976 as an expansion team, the Seahawks started in the **American Football Conference**. Playing in the **Kingdome** with the city's *Major League Baseball (MLB)* team, the **Seattle Mariners**. They played in this stadium until 1999, when the dome was demolished, where they would temporarily play at **Husky Stadium** until their new stadium, **Lumen Field**, was built in Seattle's Sodo neighborhood.

The team met with little to no success in the early years, with one of the few highlights being *Steve Laegent*, an eventual **Pro Football Hall of Fame** *wide receiver* who received many accolades throughout his years in Seattle.

## Modern Era (2000s-2020s)
After moving from the **American Football Conference (AFC)** to the **National Football Conference (NFC)** in 2002, the team had much better success. With players like *Matt Hasslbeck*, *Sean Alexander*, and *Walter Jones*, the Seahawks made their first Super Bowl in 2005, for *Super Bowl XL (40)*. Unfortunately, with some controversial officiating, they came short of victory and lost.

Following this, the team hired **Pete Carroll** in 2010 as their new head coach. And after aquirring key defensive players like **Richard Sherman**, **Kam Chancellor**, and Earl Thomas**, the *Leigon of Boom* was formed, arguabbly the greatest defense in NFL history. With the defense, and key offensive players like **Russell Wilson, Marshawn Lynch, and Doug Baldwin** the team won thier first Super Bown in 2014 agaisnt the *Denver Broncos* in 2014.
